## GraphQL Code Generation

This project make use of URQL and GraphQL Codegen to interact with the
[server][1] GraphQL API. You must generate GraphQL server bindings and then
import them to perform any queries or mutations.

> Make sure a `.env` file is available with the same contents as `.env.example`.

> Make sure `VITE_API_URL` points to an instance of [nexus-server][1]

Execute `pnpm run gql:generate` to generate the `src/lib/graphql/schema.ts`
file. You must import any queries and mutations from this file and use them in
the service implementation.
